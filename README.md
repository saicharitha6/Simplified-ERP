# Project Overview 
The goal of this project is to create a simplified interface for an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, designed to manage basic business operations efficiently. The system consists of several pages including Dashboard, Products Management, and Orders Management. Additionally, an optional feature, Orders Calendar View, can be implemented.

Dashboard Display a summary of key metrics or features (e.g., total number of products, orders, customers). Include links or buttons for quick navigation to the Products and Orders management pages.

Products Management Present a list of products with details such as name, category, price, and stock quantity, using mock data. Enable functionalities to add, edit, and delete products.

Orders Management Show a list of orders, including details like order ID, customer name, order date, and status, using mock data. (Optional) Allow viewing of order details, updating the order status, and deletion of orders.

Orders Calendar View Implement a calendar view that displays orders on their expected delivery dates. Provide the ability to click on a date to view all orders due for delivery that day.


# Usage of Project
Upon running the application, you will be directed to the Home page contains the categories of products, in nav bar provides options like dashboard which provides an overview of the system's features. Use the provided links or buttons to navigate to the Products Management, Customer Details and Orders Management pages. In the Products Management page, you can view, add, edit, and delete products. In the Orders Management page, you can view orders and optionally update order details or delete orders. Optionally, navigate to the Orders Calendar View to visualize orders based on their expected delivery dates.

I also implemented the general product listing and placing items to cart.



# Getting Started with Create React App
# Project Setup & Installation

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/saicharitha6/Simplified-ERP.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd Simplified-ERP
Install dependencies: npm install
Running the Application: npm start

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
